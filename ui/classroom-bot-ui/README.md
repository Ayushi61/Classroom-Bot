## Setup and Installations
This section gives a detailed description of the steps required to setup a development environment for the admin UI of the project.
The UI was built using react by leveraging standard react libraries. 

### Prerequisites
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
* [Docker-Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
* [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)  
    Make should be pre-installed in linux and mac os. For windows please consider setting up a virtual machine. However, this is not a hard requirement. All commands can be run locally from the Makefile in the project

### Steps to Install
Follow the below steps and commands to setup and run the admin ui locally

#### Local Installation
1. Clone the git repository and from the root folder run the below command to install all the dependencies for the Admin UI  
    `make ui.install`

2. After the installation you need to update the configuration files for the front end to point to the django api service. Navigate to the file `ui/classroom-bot-ui/.env` and update the below values  
    `REACT_APP_BACKEND_HOST = <DJANGO APP HOSTNAME>`  
    `REACT_APP_BACKEND_PORT = <DJANGO APP PORT>`  
    * Please note: in case of docker installation you can leave this as default

3. Finally navigate back to the root directory of the project and run the below command to start the development server  
    `make ui.local.start`

4. The admin ui will run in the url http://localhot:3000


#### Docker Installation
1. Clone the git repository and ensure the docker daemon on your machine is started

2. From the root directory run the below commands  
    `make ui.build`  This command will create the build of the Admin UI application in the ui/classroom-bot-ui/build path

3. Finally build the docker image and run the container using the following commands  
    `make ui.docker.build`  
    `make ui.docker.run`  

4. Similar to above the app will run in the url http://localhot:3000.

* Please ensure that the Database and the Django apis are running before you start the Admin UI

### Other relevant commands

#### Running Test Cases
In order to run the tests use the command `make ui.local.test`

#### Running Linters
In order to run linters use the command `make ui.docker.lint`. The linter will spin up a docker container and will run eslint within the container.
