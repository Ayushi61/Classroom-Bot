### Why a developer cares

1. Quantify the time taken by a user to scroll through all the resources vs using the Classroom-Bot. Contact the owner for more information on the prototype of the website that can make your as well as participants' task easy to do lab experiments.
2. Looking to work on a project that has various decoupled applications.
3. Work on each component of the project. Or Pick your choice: Django Backend, REACT UI or Docker and Tavis based DevOps, or Automated Tests
4. Make an impact for the fellow academic community.

Have look at how useful can classbot be for your classroom workspace!!!

A lot of classrooms use slack as mode of communication. 

* But what if we could turn that slack room into a complete integrated classroom experience?
* What if the professors and the TAs had a bot which could allow them to manage lot of admin tasks for their course from slack?
* What if all the students had their back by a bot which would never let them miss any deadlines, see their class schedule, 
grades, assignments and other classroom resources from slack?

The classroom bot is the bot that can satisfy all of the above **what ifs**.
